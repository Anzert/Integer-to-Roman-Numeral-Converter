  *What does the script do? 
  It takes an integer and converts it to a Roman numeral.
    It works by splitting the integer into four blocks of digits, corresponding to
    thousands, hundreds, tens, and units, and converting each block to its Roman
    numeral equivalent using a series of switch statements. The resulting Roman
    numerals are then concatenated to form the final output.
